# How I got a 15% lift in cold traffic conversions by reading one book.

Actually, it was more than just one book...

But one book specifically spawned the genius idea that gave me a 15% increase.

Want to know which book? You're in for a treat:

[Experiment!][0] by Colin McFarland, grab a copy [here][0], who knows what you'll get out of it. ;) 

So here's exactly what I learned from mister McFarland about testing:

1. Too often people test everything and anything without really understanding if that's the right thing to test. The only place you should be testing are areas of drop offs or signs of bottle necking. 

What does that mean?

The best ROI on your time used for testing should be in areas of your sales funnel or business operation where there are people getting stuck. When people get stuck and they can't move forward in your sales funnel or you lose out.

After reading that, I instantly asked my CMO, Hey Ben, where do we get the biggest drop off in our funnel, where are we losing people?

His answer was very simple; the first page haha, talk about rough...

Then he adds, "95% of visitors on the first page drop off."

WOW, 95% of people bounce the page at first sight haha so it clicked for me, we need something new that'll grab people attention and keep them on the page.

Thus, I created this new headline that increased our cold traffic conversation rates by 15%:

"Only 5% of people will learn how to use this secret formula" 

Here are the thoughts that lead up to that very specific headline:

1. What a great angle, if 95% of people bounce, only 5% of people will ever see this information. Let's flip it!
2. I remembered reading a book that said using specific numbers are more compelling. Hence, the use of 5%.
3. I also read Made to Stick by blah blah said, people are compelled by secrets and forbidden things. We are curious creatures.

Seems pretty simple huh?

If you want to see my headline in action, click [here][1].

Here's a recap of how you can increase your conversion rates in your business or even just your sales funnel:

1. READ! READ! READ!
2. Find areas of bottle neck, places in your business where you should be testing. Don't waste your time testing the font of your page. Don't major in the minors and minors in the majors...
3. Use specific numbers, the human brain can understand and relate to specific numbers a lot easier than giving them a vague or general idea. Make it easy for them, give them your message on a silver platter.
4. Be compelling, use ideas of secrecy just like how I did or anything that feeds into the curious cat that lives in all of us.

I hope this blog post helped you understand how I work, how well I perform, and how I can pass along my knowledge.

Please let me know what you think.
