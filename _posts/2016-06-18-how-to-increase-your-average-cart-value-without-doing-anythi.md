# How To Increase Your Average Cart Value Without Doing Anything New

What's the reasoning behind live events being so successful?

Is it sloely because we are all social creatures and the thought of gathering together in one place excites us to death?

Yes, if you have a killer event and EVERYONE wants to go.

But, what if that's not the case? What if you're low on ticket sales, what if only a small portion of your email list can fly out and attend your event?

I'm going to show you how live events are able to increase their revenue without doing anything drastically new or crazy.

Here are four easy ways to increase the average cart value of live events and even create profit from people who don't want to attend:

1. Offer your ticket purchasers video footage of the entire event! Get a camera crew, capture the whole thing and get them on dvds or a digital copy. Heck, turn it into a course and then sell that.
2. Offer your ticket purchasers professionally written notes of the ENTIRE event. God only knows that EVERYONE CANNOT TAKE NOTES FOR THEIR LIVES. Plus, a lot of people can't focus that long and some even fall asleep. Giving them a nice protective blanket of notes will allow them to absorb the event nicely, instead of rushing through the entire experience.
3. Offer both number 1 & 2 to everyone who can't make it! People live too far, people have family and they can't just leave, and people have money conversations that hold them back! Offer them the notes or the video replay as a product!
4. If number three doesn't work, offer live streaming! You're giving them the entire event without needing them to leave the comfort of their home. Now, no one can have an excuse anymore. 

Using this method, I was able to help my company generate an additional $66,000 of revenue. You do the math, all we had to pay for was a film crew, editors, no dvds were made because we live in 2016, and a note taker. 

Give one or more of these tips a shot and let me know what you were able to create.
