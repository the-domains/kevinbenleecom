# Do You Have A Cursed Personality?

Charlie Munger said, "_That many hard problems are best solved only when they're addressed backwards."_  
I once heard that if you want to become the best poker player in the world, just find out how to be the worst poker player... and don't do any of that! Haha.  
So there are four personality types that almost ALWAYS fail in business.  
I hope you're not one of these...  
**The Starter**  
If you are great at starting projects, but get bored easily, then you have "shiny-object" syndrome. You lack the discipline to finish what you started. You begin strong, but always seem to slowly fall apart as time passes because you have your eyes set on something more exciting. I hope this doesn't translate to your personal life...  
**The Planner**  
If someone has ever told you to stop overthinking, you're most likely a planner. You're great at making plans, creating spreadsheets, and mapping out goals - but you're still at the place where you started. You're always experiencing analysis-paralysis and use the excuse,_"It's not ready yet... I'm a perfectionist."_You're stuck in and never moving forward.  
**The Socializer**  
You're a social butterfly. You love to have fun and be everyone's best friend. You talk too much and always get distracted from getting things done. You know how to put your business out there but you can get carried away. You enjoy socializing more than the success of your business. This can hurt you because you're running around doing a lot of "work," but nothing really gets done.  
**The Doubter**  
You have an awesome idea, great business plan, but you're scared of taking risks. You want to start your own business, but you also enjoy your steady paycheck and daily routine. You have doubts about yourself and whether or not you can make it out there as an entrepreneur. You're always scared of the unknown and that holds you back from everything, not just as a business owner.  
Does the list above scare you? Do you feel like you have a little bit of each personality?  
Don't worry, we all have these traits in us.  
Guess what I am.  
The only difference between a successful entrepreneur and an unsuccessful one, is that the successful entrepreneur has a balance of all four personalities.  
John Sviokla and Mitch Cohen, the authors of _[The Self-Made Billionaire Effect ][0]_said, _"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function."_  
I still struggle with balancing all of these traits myself. What has helped me is to find people with personality traits that will balance out mine. I love to talk and can get carried away sometimes, but the people I surround myself with does a great job of redirecting my focus.  
Let me know what your personality type is? :)

Stay Charged,
